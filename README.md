This plugin is based on the CustomPluginTab of rainloop and enable Hmailserver auto-reply directly rainloop user settings.

NOTA: This plugin works only with hmailserver and a mysql based database.

Auto-reply is set by directly modifying the database. Thus, based on the cache of hmailserver, modifications are applied with a maximum of that cache duration. (It's a setting in hmailserver)

Once plugin activated in the rainloop admin, you can configure the database host, user, pass and table in that admin area. (click on the plugin name in the plugin list)
